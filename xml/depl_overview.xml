 <para>
  &productname; is based on &sls;, &ostack;, &crow;, and &chef;. &sls; is used
  as the underlying operating system for all cloud infrastructure machines
  (also called nodes), whereas &ostack;, the cloud management layer, works as
  the <quote>Cloud Operating System</quote>. &crow; and &chef; are used to
  automatically deploy and manage the &ostack; nodes from a central &admserv;.

 <para>
  &productname; is deployed to four different types of machines:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    one &admserv; for node deployment and management
   </para>
  </listitem>

    several &stornode;s for block and object storage
   </para>
  </listitem>

 <sect1 id="sec.depl.arch.components.admin">
  <title>The &admserv;</title>
  <para>
   The &admserv; provides all services needed to manage and deploy all
   other nodes in the cloud. Most of these services are provided by the
   &crow; tool that automates in conjunction with &chef; all the required
   installation and configuration tasks. Among the services provided by
   the server are DHCP, DNS, NTP, PXE, TFTP.

  <para>
   The &admserv; also hosts the software repositories for &sls; and
   &productname;, since they are needed for node deployment. Optionally (if no
   other sources for the software repositories are available) it can also host
   the &smtool; (&smt;), providing up-to-date repositories with updates and
   patches for all nodes.

  <title>The &contrnode;</title>
  <para>
   The &contrnode; hosts all &ostack; services needed to orchestrate virtual
   machines deployed on the &compnode;s in the &cloud;. &ostack; on &cloud;
   uses a &postgres; database. It is managed and deployed through the
   &admserv;. The following &ostack; components and dependencies run on the
   &contrnode;:

   In addition to that, the management parts of the compute and storage
   services also run on the &contrnode;.
  </para>

 <sect1 id="sec.depl.arch.components.compute">
  <title>The &compnode;s</title>
  <para>
   The &compnode;s are the pool of machines on which the &vmguest;s are
   running. These machines need to be equipped with a sufficient number of
   CPUs and enough RAM to start several &vmguest;s. The &contrnode;
   effectively distributes &vmguest;s within the pool of &compnode;s and
   provides the necessary network resources. The &ostack; service &comp;
   (Nova) runs on the &compnode;s and provides means for setting up, starting,
   and stopping virtual machines.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1 id="sec.depl.arch.components.storage">
  <title>The &stornode;s</title>
  <para>
   The &stornode;s are the pool of machines providing storage. &cloud; offers
   two different types of storage: object and block storage. Object storage is
   provided by the &ostack; &swift; component, while block storage is provided
   by Nova Volume.
  </para>
  <para>
   Nova Volume can use different backends. By default it will use the LVM
   backend with iSCSI on the &contrnode;. Alternatively, it can use &ceph;'s
   RADOS Block Device (RBD).  As of &productname; &productnumber;, &ceph; is
   not officially supported but rather included as a technical preview, so
   using Nova Volume without &ceph; is recommended.
  </para>
  <para>
   Deploying &swift; is optional.
