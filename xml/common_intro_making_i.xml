 <title>About the Making of This Manual</title>

 <para> This book is written in Novdoc, a subset of DocBook (see <ulink
   url="http://www.docbook.org"/>). The XML source files were validated by
  <command>xmllint</command>, processed by <command>xsltproc</command>, and
  converted into XSL-FO using a customized version of Norman Walsh's
  stylesheets. The final PDF can be formatted through FOP from Apache or through
  XEP from RenderX. The authoring and publishing tools used to produce this
  manual are available in the package <systemitem class="resource"
   >daps</systemitem>. The DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (DAPS) is
  developed as open source software. For more information, see <ulink
   url="http://daps.sf.net/"/>.
