  This guide provides system administrators with the information needed to
  deploy and maintain the &cloud; administrative units, the &admserv; and the
  &contrnode;:
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>&admserv;</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The &admserv; provides all services needed to manage and deploy all other
     nodes in the cloud. Most of these services are provided by the &crow;
     tool that automates in conjunction with Chef all the required
     installation and configuration tasks. Among the services provided by the
     server are DHCP, DNS, NTP, PXE, TFTP.
    </para>
    <para>
     Updates and patches for all &sled;-based nodes in the &cloud; need to be
     delivered by the &smtool; (&smt;). The &smt; service can either run on a
     dedicated machine within the cloud network or can also run on the
     &admserv;.

     Before starting to install and configure your cluster, make yourself
     familiar with cluster fundamentals and architecture, get an overview of
     the key features and benefits. Learn which hardware and software
     requirements must be met and what preparations to take before executing
     the next steps. Perform the installation and basic setup of your HA
     cluster using &yast;.

     <xref linkend="part.config" xrefstyle="select:title,nopage"/>

    <listitem>
     <para>
     Add, configure and manage cluster resources, using either the graphical
     user interface (&hbgui;), the Web interface (&haweb;), or the command
     line interface (<command>crm</command> shell). To avoid unauthorized
     access to the cluster configuration, define roles and assign them to
     certain users for fine-grained control. Learn how to make use of load
     balancing and fencing or how to set up a multi-site cluster. In case
     you consider writing your own resource agents or modifying existing
     ones, get some background information on how to create different types
     of resource agents.

     &productname; ships with a cluster-aware file system and volume
     manager: Oracle Cluster File System (OCFS2) and the clustered Logical
     Volume Manager (cLVM). For replication of your data, use DRBD*
     (Distributed Replicated Block Device) to mirror the data of a &ha;
     service from the active node of a cluster to its standby node.
     Furthermore, a clustered Samba server also provides a &ha; solution for
     heterogeneous environments.
