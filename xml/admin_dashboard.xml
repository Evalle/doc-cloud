 <title>Using &cloud; &dash;</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>The &cloud; &dash; is a Web interface that allows cloud administrators
  to manage various &ostack; services, like managing and creating images, creating 
  keypairs, or attaching volumes to instances. It is based on &ostack; &dash;
  (also known as <literal>Horizon</literal>). 
   <remark>taroth 2012-07-04: not sure about the CLI - if it has the same scope,
   a basic administration chapter in front of this one migth be useful
   to explain the underlying logic - maybe something for next revision</remark>

   <remark>taroth 2012-07-04: DEVs, any requirements for the browser from which
   to use &dash; (Firefox, Chrome, Opera)? or does it work with any browser that

       <remark>taroth 2012-07-04: DEVs, may it happen that a certificate

      <!--<note>
       <title>Certificate Warning</title>
       <para>
       Depending on your browser and browser options, you may get a
       certificate warning when trying to access the URL for the first time.
       This is because &hawk; uses a self-signed certificate that is not
       considered trustworthy per default.
      </para>
       <para>
       To proceed anyway, you can add an exception in the browser to bypass
       the warning. To avoid the warning in the first place, the self-signed
       certificate can also be replaced with a certificate signed by an
       official Certificate Authority. For information on how to do so,
       refer to <xref linkend="vle.ha.hawk.certificate"/>.
