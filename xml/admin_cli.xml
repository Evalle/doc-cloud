 <title>Using &ostack; Command Line Interfaces</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>The &ostack; project provides a variety of command line tools with
 which you can manage the services within your cloud.
 The command line interface also allows for automation of administration tasks 
 as you can use the command in scripts. Each <remark>?</remark> of the core 
 &ostack; services has its own command line tool: for example, 
 use <command>keystone</command> for managing users and projects, 
 <command>nova</command> for managing instances and flavors, or 
 <command>glance</command> for managing images.</para>

command lines tools is: http://wiki.openstack.org/UnifiedCLI,

  <title>Managing Images</title>
  <para>Images can only be uploaded to &productname; with the <command>glance</command>
  line tool. As the &ostack; project currently aims to unify the multiple command 
  line tools, there are currently two divergent variants of the <command>glance</command>
  command available: the older one is contained in the package 
  <systemitem class="resource">openstack-glance</systemitem>, the newer one in
  the package <systemitem class="resource">python_glanceclient</systemitem>. 
  You cannot install both packages in parallel. This manual describes the use of 
  the <command>glance</command> variant that is contained in 
  <systemitem class="resource">openstack-glance</systemitem>.
