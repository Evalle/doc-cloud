 <title>Using &ostack; Command Line Interfaces</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>The &ostack; project provides a variety of command line tools with
   which you can manage the services within your cloud and automate 
   administration tasks by using scripts. Each of the core &ostack; components 
   has its own command line tool.</para>

  <remark>taroth 2012-08-03: todo - check with bmwiedemann if the following is 
  only true for glance or also for the other commands</remark>
  Therefore, divergent variants of the command line tools listed above are available:
  the older ones are contained in the packages 
  <literal>openstack-<replaceable>SERVICE</replaceable>

  in the packages <literal>python_<replaceable>SERVICE</replaceable>client</literal>. 
  As those packages conflict, you cannot install both variants of a command in
