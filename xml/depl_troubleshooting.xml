   Find solutions for the most common pitfalls here. If your problem is not
   mentioned here, checking the log files on either the &admserv; or the
   &ostack; nodes may help. A list of log files is available at <xref

      <para>
       By default you cannot directly log in to a node as &rootuser;, because
       the nodes were set up without a &rootuser; password. You can only log in
       via SSH from the &admserv;. You should be able to log in to a node with
       <command>ssh&nbsp;root@<replaceable>NAME</replaceable></command> where
       <replaceable>NAME</replaceable> is the name (alias) of the node.

      <para>
       If name resolution does not work, go to the &crow; Web interface and

    2012-09-07 - fs: Do we have some official text on cloud and support we
    could use here?
   </remark>
   Whenever you contact support to help you with a problem on &cloud;, it is
   strongly recommended that you gather as much information about your system
   and the problem as possible. For this purpose &productname; ships with a
   tool called <command>supportconfig</command>. It gathers system information
   such as the current kernel version being used, the hardware, RPM database,
   partitions, and other items. <command>supportconfig</command> also collects the
   most important log files, making it easier for the supporters to identify
   and solve your problem.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is recommended to always run <command>supportconfig</command> on the
   &admserv; as well as on the &contrnode;. If a &compnode; or a &stornode; is
   part of the problem, run <command>supportconfig</command> on the affected
   node as well. For details on how to run <command>supportconfig</command>,
   please refer to <ulink
   url="http://www.suse.com/documentation/sles11/book_sle_admin/data/cha_adm_support.html"/>.
