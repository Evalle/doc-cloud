 <title>Launching Instances in &cloud; &dash;</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>Instances are virtual machines that run inside the cloud. To start
  an instance, you must have a virtual machine image that contains the following 
  information: which operating system to use, a user name and password with which 
  to log in to the &vmguest;, file storage etc. The cloud contains
  a pool of such images that cloud administrators have uploaded and made
  accessible to members of different projects. Apart from the image to use,
  you also need to specify the <quote>size</quote> of the VM to start 
  (called <literal>flavor</literal> in &ostack;) and to provide an SSH key. If 
  you want to make the virtual machine accessible from outside the
	cloud, you need to configure security groups. If needed, block storage
	devices (<literal>volumes</literal>) can be attached to a running
	instance (or detached and attached to another instance at any time).</para>

 <!--basic steps and tasks:
    * create keypair
    * configure security groups
    * launch instance
   [* log in to instance (SSH/VNC)] 
    * create volume
    * attach volume to instance/remove volume from instance
    * terminate/shut down instance

  <title>Creating or Importing Keys</title>
  <para>Before you can launch instances, you need to create a keypair. Keypairs
  are SSH credentials that are injected into images when they are launched.

   one keypair per image to launch?
